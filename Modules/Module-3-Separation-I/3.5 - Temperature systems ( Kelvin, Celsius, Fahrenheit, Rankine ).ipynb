    "Several accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist. According to one account, the lower defining point, 0 °F, was established as the temperature of a solution of brine made from equal parts of ice and salt. Further limits were established as the melting point of ice (32 °F) and his best estimate of the average human body temperature (96 °F, about 2.6 °F less than the modern value due to a later redefinition of the scale).\n",

Zero on both the Kelvin and Rankine scales is absolute zero, **but a temperature difference of one Rankine degree is defined as equal to one Fahrenheit degree**, rather than the Celsius degree used on the Kelvin scale.
