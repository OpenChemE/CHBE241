    "**Recycle** and **purge** streams are an extension of **splitter** streams, whereby one of the product streams from the splitter is routed back into a previous process as a recycle stream and one is directed out of the process as a purge stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a recycle stream is to take unreacted reactants and reuse them, ensuring the highest process efficiency possible. Purge streams are necessary to ensure there is little to no accumulation in the system from the recycle stream feeding back into the fresh feed, preventing dilution of reactants due to waste chemicals. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** While the splitter product streams have the same compositions, recycle and purge stream compositions can be different from their inlet stream.\n",

If the **fresh feed** stream does not have a flow rate listed in the question or the diagram, assume a mass or molecular flow rate of a random number, preferably a mass flow rate with a nice round number like 100 $kg/h$ or 100 $mol/hr$. We **cannot** assume a basis for the reactor feed, since it will depend on the sum of the fresh feed and the recycle stream.\n",
