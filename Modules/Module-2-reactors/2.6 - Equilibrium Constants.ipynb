    "In the reaction shown above, the reactants form products and the products form reactants. When you put the ethylene in water, the forward reaction occurs. Once ethanol is present, the revese reaction begins. As the concentrations of the $C_2 H_5$ and $H_2 O$ decrease, the rate of the decreases until the a point is reached where the forward and reverse reaction rate are the same. This forward and reverse reaction is an **equilibrium**.\n",
