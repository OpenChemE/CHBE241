    "When any type of fuel is burned, the carbon in the fuel reacts wit oxygen to form either $C O_2$ or $C O$. To simplify question, we often assume that the combustion is **complete**, meaning the only by products are $C O_2$ and $H_2 O$, but that is often not the case. When $C O$ is a product of the combustion, we call the reaction a **partial combustion** or an **incomplete combustion**. An example of this is the combustion of propane:\n",
