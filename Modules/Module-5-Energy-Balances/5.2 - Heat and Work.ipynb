    "There is gas in the reactor cylinder. The initial gas temperature is 20 &deg;C. The cylinder is placed in boiling water with the piston held in a fixed position. Heat in the amount of 2.00 kcal is transferred to the gas, which equilibrates at 100 &deg;C. The pressure has also found to be increased at equilibrium. The piston is then released, and the gas does 100 J of work in moving the piston to its new equilibrium position. The final gas temperature is 100 &deg;C."
