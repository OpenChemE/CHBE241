    "**Input-output diagrams** are the first step in designing a chemical process. An input-output diagram is the simplest form of flow diagrams used in industry. Input-output diagrams consist of one block with the inputs coming in one end and the outputs going out the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step in designing a chemical process is constructing a **block flow diagram** (BFD). A BFD is similar to an input-output diagram except a BFD has multiple blocks. The blocks in a BFD can represent anything from a single piece of equipment to multiple pieces of equipment.\n",

This model is also much more detailed than an input-output diagram. Each block can represent a specific step in the process. Here is an example of benzene production:\n",
