    "First, let's define what is a **dimension** and what is a **unit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensions are a measurable extent of some __base quantities__, such as length $(L)$, time $(T)$, mass $(M)$ etc. Units are labels for different dimensions and __combination of dimensions__, such as kilograms $(kg)$, Newtons $(N)$, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensional homogeneity is the concept where the dimensions of variables on __both sides__ of an equation are __the same__. If the __units are the same__, the dimensions of each term __must_ be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every __valid__ equation must be dimensionally homogeneous: that is, all additive terms on both sides of the equation must have the same dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Length = \\frac{Length}{Time} \\times Time$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is an example of a dimensionally homogenous equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An equation could be dimensionally homogenous but invalid if the equation is also not fully-balanced** i.e.\n",

    "Yes. Take the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u(m/s) = u_0(m/s) + g(m/{s^2})\\cdot t(s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is **dimensionally homogenous and consistent in units**. The only dimensions after variables are reduced are Mass $(M)$ and Time $(T^{-1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ MT^{-1} = MT^{-1} + MT^{-2} \\cdot T $$\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if we neglect to put the $t$ variable that converts the gravitational constant to velocity, the equation become **dimensionally inhomogeneous and inconsistent in units**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u(m/s) = u_0(m/s) + g(m/{s^2})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ MT^{-1} = MT^{-1} + MT^{-2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of an equation being **dimensionally homogenous but inconsistent in units** is if the units on one side of the equation are different than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u(m/min) = u_0(m/min) + g(m/{min^2})\\cdot t(s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, usually the fix is to take the variable with the wrong units and use the appropriate conversion to assign the proper units to it. (In this case, it's dividing $t$ by 60 to change it into minutes)."
