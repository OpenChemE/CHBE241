The higher the quality, which is defined by its purity, the higher the price. Although high purity feedstock is more expensive, the presence of impurities creates more **unwanted by-products** and waste products from the reaction. Impurities can also reduce the effectiveness of catalyst and increase corrosion so there is a middle ground that needs to be found. Feedstock falls under the GEP figure of merit.\n",

Every catalyst works differently but the main idea behind it is that they lower the activation energy needed to allow a chemical reaction to occur.

    "You are the lead chemical engineer at a chemical plant in Burnaby. One of your employees has suggest using a new catalyst that costs \\$200 per tonne of product more than the current catalyst you use, but lowers energy need by 5 MWh per tonne of product. The total power used per tonne is 10 MWh the cost of energy in BC is \\$0.0858 per kWh for the first 1,350 kWh and \\$0.1287 for anything over the 1,350 kWh threshold. Is this a viable replacement? Which figure or figures of merit will you be affecting by this change?\n",

    "### Answer \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the plant already uses 10 MWh, we will already be past the first threshold even with the savings. Therefore the only price we need to worry about is \\$0.1287."
