Different unit operations have different functionalities and purposes. We will cover **mixers**, **reactors**, **separators**, and **splitters** in this course.\n",

    "In a process, a **mixer** is a unit operation that attempts to make a **heterogeneous** system into a **homogenous** system. Examples include scrambling eggs, mixing sugar and cream into coffee, and a Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor used in water treatment. A mixer allows heat and/or mass transfer to occur between one or more streams. \n",
