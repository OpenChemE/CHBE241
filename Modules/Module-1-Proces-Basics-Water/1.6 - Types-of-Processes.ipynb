    "\n",
    "2. This __depends__ the output flow is always constant as the rollercoaster will take x amount of people at a constant rate. If the input of people is constant, then this is a continuous process. If there are a staggered amount of people coming in at different times then this is a fed-batch process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Watch the control volume of this one.  The focus of this is on a single class.  If the whole class finishes at the same time then this would-be a __batch process__, however; this is not the case. A __fed-batch__ is more representative as there are students joining from exchange and leaving for co-op at varying rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This problem is an extension of problem 3. now instead of the control volume being one class of students it is the department that hosts all chemical engineering students. This is best represented by a __continuous__ process. Students are getting admitted at a constant rate and leaving at a constant rate as well."
