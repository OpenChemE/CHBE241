    "\n",
    "When using heat of reaction, the units are often given in $kJ/mol$. The problem with this unit is moles of what? To clarify, when calculating for the change in enthalpy, we use this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta H = \\frac{\\Delta \\hat{H}_r (T_0,P_0)}{\\mid \\nu_A \\mid} \\space n_{A,r} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta H = \\text{Is the change in enthalpy} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\hat{H}_r (T_0,P_0) = \\text{Is the heat of reaction at temperature and pressure} \\space T_0 \\space \\text{and} \\space P_0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nu_A = \\text{Is the stoichiometric coefficient of species A} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ n_{A,r} = \\text{Is the moles of A that reacted} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In module 2 we defined the **extent of reaction**, $\\xi$, as a measure how far a reaction advanced. The equation for extent of reaction is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\xi = \\frac{n_{A,r}}{\\mid \\nu_A \\mid} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this equation, we can simplify the change in enthalpy equation to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta H = \\Delta \\hat{H}_r (T_0,P_0) \\cdot \\xi $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation states that by using the extent of reaction we can have a basis to evaluate the stoichiometry. Because of this, we can find the heat of reaction by being given any compound in the reaction.\n",

    "## 6.2.4 &ndash; Important Terms and Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If $\\Delta \\hat{H}_r (T,P)$ is negative, the reaction is exothermic at the temperature and pressure T and P, and if $\\Delta \\hat{H}_r (T,P)$ is positive the reaction is endothermic at T and P.\n",
    "2. At low and moderate pressures, $\\Delta \\hat{H}_r (T,P)$ is nearly independent of pressure. Thus, the heat of reaction will become $\\Delta \\hat{H}_r (T)$. We will mostly be using this type of heat of reaction.\n",
    "3. The value of the heat of reaction depends on the how the stoichiometric equation is write. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ H_{2} \\small{\\text{(g)}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\space O_{2 } \\small{\\text{(g)}} \\longrightarrow 2 \\space H_2 O \\small{\\text{(v)}} \\quad \\Delta \\hat{H}_r = -241.8 \\space \\frac{kJ}{mol}$$\n",

    "    \n",
    "4. The magnitude of the heat of reaction depends on the phase of the products, whether it be gas, liquid, or solid. For example,\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$ C H_{4} \\small{\\text{(g)}} + 2 \\space O_{2 } \\small{\\text{(g)}} \\longrightarrow C O_{2} \\small{\\text{(g)}} + 2 \\space H_2 O \\small{\\text{(v)}} \\quad \\Delta \\hat{H}_r -802.3 \\space \\frac{kJ}{mol}$$\n",

    "    \n",
    "    This concept will be discussed in greater detail in the **latent heat** section.\n",
    "5. The **standard heat of reaction**, denoted by $\\Delta \\hat{H}_r ^{\\circ}$, is the heat of reaction at a specific reference point, usually $25 ^{\\circ} C$ and $1$ atm.\n",
