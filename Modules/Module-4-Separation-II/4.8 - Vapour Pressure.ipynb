    "As you can see in the figure bellow, vapour pressure is at equilibrium. This means that there is as much vapour being produced from evaporation as vapour being consumed due to condensation. The magnitude of the vapour pressure tells you how volatile the liquid is. The higher the vapour pressure, the higher the volatility.\n",
