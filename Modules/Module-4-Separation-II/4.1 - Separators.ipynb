    "\n",
    "**Liquid-Liquid Extraction** is the separation of compounds based on their solubilityâ€™s. It is an extraction of a substance from one liquid to another. A feed solution that contains the desired **solute** or **solutes** is mixed with a **solvent**. This mixing allows the solute to readily dissolve in the solvent since the solute is more soluble in the solvent. The exiting stream with the solute and solvent is called the **extract**. The waste stream is called the **raffinate**.\n",
