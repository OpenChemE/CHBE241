    "### Question \n",
    "\n",
    "You are a chemical engineer at the Burnaby oil refinery. Your colleague has asked you to inform him on how much gasoline is flowing through a pipe in **SCFH**. You measure the flow rate and find that gasoline is flowing at $1.2 \\space m^3/s$ at $30 ^{\\circ} C$ The reference point for the density of gasoline is $\\rho = 730 \\space kg/m^3$ at $15 ^{\\circ} C$. The correction factor for the gasoline at $30 ^{\\circ} C$ is $\\alpha_{\\space 30 ^{\\circ} C} = 0.9811$. The correction factor for the gasoline at $0 ^{\\circ} C$ is $\\alpha_{\\space 0 ^{\\circ} C} = 1.0187$. What is the flow volumetric SCFH flow rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must find the mass flow rate at $30 ^{\\circ} C$. This is because mass must be conserved at any temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{m} = \\dot{V}_{\\space 30 ^{\\circ} C} \\cdot (\\rho_{\\space 15 ^{\\circ} C} \\cdot \\alpha_{\\space 30 ^{\\circ} C}) = 1.2 \\space \\frac{m^3}{s} \\cdot \\bigg(  730 \\space \\frac{kg}{m^3} \\cdot 0.9811 \\bigg) = 859 \\space \\frac{kg}{s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the mass flow rate, we can calculate the volumetric flow rate at $0 ^{\\circ} C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{V}_{\\space 0 ^{\\circ} C} = \\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\rho_{\\space 15 ^{\\circ} C} \\cdot \\alpha_{\\space 0 ^{\\circ} C}} = \\frac{859 \\space \\frac{kg}{s}}{730 \\space \\frac{kg}{m^3} \\cdot 1.0187} = 1.06 \\space \\frac{m^3}{s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can convert the volumetric flow rate to the proper units of $ft^3/h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\dot{V}_{\\space 0 ^{\\circ} C} = 1.06 \\space \\frac{m^3}{s} \\times \\frac{35.31 \\space ft^3}{1 \\space m^3} \\times \\frac{3600 \\space s}{1 \\space h} = 134,700 \\space \\text{SCFH}$$"
