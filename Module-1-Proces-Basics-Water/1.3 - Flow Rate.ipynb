    "By the end of this section you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the concept of flow rate.\n",
    "2. Convert one type of flow rate into another.\n",
    "3. Know how flow rates are measured.\n",
    "4. Have a basic understanding of differential pressure.\n",

    "\n",
    "Almost every process involves the movement of material from one point to another. The movement of material is present between process units, production facilities, and transportation depots. The rate at which materials are transported is the **flow rate**."

    "## 1.3.2 &ndash; Mass Flow Rate\n",
    "**Mass flow rate** is the measurement of mass per unit time (mass/time). This flowrate is usually denoted by the character $ \\dot{m} $, where $ \\dot{m} = \\frac{ kg }{s} $. Since mass must be conserved, the input masses of a process must equal the output masses, unless there is accumulation. Therefore, mass flowrate is a very useful tool in solving material balances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3.3 &ndash; Molar Flow Rate\n",
    "**Molar flow rate** is the measurement of moles per unit time (mole/time). This flowrate is usually denoted by the character $ \\dot{n} $, where $ \\dot{n} = \\frac{ moles }{s} $. Since the total number of moles of atomic species (eg. N, O, C) must be conserved, it is useful in solving both reactive and non-reactive problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3.4 &ndash; Volumetric Flow Rate\n",
    "**Volumetric flow rate** is the measurement of volume per unit time (volume/time) This flow rate is usually denoted by the character $ \\dot{V} $, where $ \\dot{V} = \\frac{ m^3 }{s} $. Volumetric flow rate may change with density. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\rho = \\frac{m}{V} = \\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\dot{V}} = \\frac{\\frac{kg}{s}}{\\frac{m^3}{s}} = \\frac{kg}{m^3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\dot{m} = \\rho \\dot{V} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Since mass flow rate is more useful, but volumetric flow rate is easier to measure, we use the formula shown above to convert from one basis to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although density is nearly conserved for solids and liquids, it is not for gases. For example, if a gas is flowing through a nozzle, the mass flow rate will not change but the gas will compress or expand. \n",

    "\n",
    "Flow rates are measured by a device called a **flowmeter**. This device provides a continuous reading of the flow rate in the line. Two commonly used flowmeters are rotameters and orifice meters.\n",
