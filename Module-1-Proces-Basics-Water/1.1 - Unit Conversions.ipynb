    "By the end of this section you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand why **converting units** properly is important.\n",
    "2. What **converting factors** are.\n",
    "3. How to convert from one unit to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how to **convert units** is vital to engineers. Improperly converted units could mean the difference between life and death. With Canada's proximity to the USA, it is very important to learn how to convert from imperial to metric and vise versa. It is also important to know how to convert from one unit to another in the same system such as $m^3$ to $l$."

    "## Conversion Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conversion factors** are ratios between two expressions of the same quantity. For an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1 cm}{10 mm} \\quad \\text{(1 centimeter per 10 millimeters)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1 kg^2}{1,000,000 g^2} \\quad \\text{(1 kilogram squared per 1,000,000 grams squared)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1 m^3}{1,000,000,000 mm^3} \\quad \\text{(1 cubic meter per 1,000,000,000 cubic millimeters)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting Units\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a quantity from one unit to its equivalent of another unit, we will use conversion factors. For example, if we want to convert 7.2 km to meters, we would write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 7.2 km \\times \\frac{1,000 m}{1 km} = 7,200 m  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the original unit is km, the final unit is m, and the conversion factor is $ \\frac{1,000m}{1km} $."
