    "In wastewater treatement, an important step in the process is sedimentation. Sedimentation is the process of allowing particulate matter in a fluid to settle to the bottom of a tank. In the sedimentation step, a coagulant can be used to coagulate bacteria and fine particles to allow the sedimentation to occur faster. The most common molecular species used for coagulation is alum, $Al_2 (SO_4)_3 \\cdot 14H_2 O $.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a chemical engineer working in a waste water treatment plant. You are asked to make a material balance on the sedamentation process. Waste water flows into a sedimentation tank at 200 L/s. The waste water contains 1 wt% of bacteria, and 20 wt% of other particulate matter. Alum is added to the sedimentation tank. Alum allows 99% of the bacteria and partculate matter to settle. The sludge at the bottom of the tank exists the tank with 40 wt% of water and the balance bacteria and partuclate matter. The semi-treated water exits the tank in a seperate stream.\n",
