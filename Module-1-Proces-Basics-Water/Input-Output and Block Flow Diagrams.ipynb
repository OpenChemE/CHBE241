    "**Input-output diagrams** are the first step in designing a chemical process. An input-output diagrams is the simplest form of flow diagrams used in industry. Input-output diagrams consist of one block with the inputs coming in one end and the outputs going out the other. The next step in designing a chemical process is constructing a **Block flow diagram** (BFD). A BFD is similar to an input-output diagram except a BFD has multiple blocks. The blocks in a BFD can represent anything from a single piece of equipment to multiple pieces of equipment."

    "**Block flow diagrams** are what we will mainly focus on later in the course. This model focuses on a section, sections, or a whole chemical plant. This model is also much more detailed than an Input-Output Diagram. Each block can represent a specific step in the process. Here is an example of benzene production:\n",

    "As you can see, there are two inputs, 10,000 kg/h of Toluene, and 820 kg/h of Hydrogen. There are also two outputs, 2,610 kg/h of Mixed Gas, and 8,210 kg/h of Benzene. In-between the outputs and inputs are the specific **unit operations**. This example may seem complicated but by the end of this course it will be a walk in the park.\n"
