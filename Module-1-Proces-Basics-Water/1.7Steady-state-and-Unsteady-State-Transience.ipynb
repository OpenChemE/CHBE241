    "Steady-state and unsteady-state processes describe the time interval that a process occurs over. steady-state refers to the time period where the __variable of interest doesn't change__. Unsteady-state is when the varible of interest __changes over time.__ While all processes have a steady-state and __transient__ phase, it is more beneficial to evaluate certain processes with steady-state or transience.\n",

    "__ Note: __ Steady-state is often referred to as __S.S__, you may see that written in problems. Transience is  used __interchangeably__ with unsteady-state. It will be referred in this section interchangeably You may see problems using __U.S.S__"

    "## When to use Steady State and Unsteady state\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for minor fluctuations, steady-state indicates that there is no change in  the variable of interest. A can of pop lying outside is at steady-state because it will not change temperature suddenly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, it is best to analyze continuous flow reactors using steady state analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsteady state processes have a definitive change over time. Boiling water takes room temperatured water and raises it to 100 C over a set time. Because of this, batch and fed-batch reactors are often analyzed using unsteady-state methods.\n",

    "The following section will cover how the analysis is carried out."
