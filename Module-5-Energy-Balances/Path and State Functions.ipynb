    "> Remember that guy who went up Mount Everest? Imagine you are a tourist at the bottom and see that guy on top of the mountain. __Regardless of how he got there__, that guy got there and is 8,848m higher than you are and thus he has 8679888J of potential energy  more than you (assuming they weigh 100kg). \n",

    " A __State function__ is the change of the state of a variable __regardless of the path it takes__\n",
    "\n",
    "> But __how __did that guy get up there? Did skydive out of a plane? Did he climb up there himself? Was he carried up by a sherpa? now we are concerned about the path the guy took to get up there. \n",
    "\n",
    "A __Path function__ is the transition of __path variables__ from one state to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Work__ $W$ and __Heat__ $Q$ are path variables. They change depending on what path is chosen to reach a state.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Internal Energy__ $U$, __Enthalpy__ $E$, __Pressure__ $p$, __Temperature__ $T$, and __Volume__ $V$ are state functions. \n",

    "In Path 1, the system is raised to a point of high pressure and then expanded to the state U2.\n",

    "\n",
    "As Work is $P \\Delta V $,  it is clear that the work done is much greater in the first system. This is because the pressure is much higher. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Furthermore:__ We can infer that there is more heat transfered to system 1 since U2 is constant for both and using the information from the first law $U = Q  - W $ , if W is larger, than Q must be larger to raise the value of U2 \n",
