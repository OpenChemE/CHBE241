    "Often we do not know the absolute value of internal energy or enthalpy $\\ \\hat{U}, \\hat{H}$. To give us a way of measuring these values, a __reference state__ is chosen to represent __0__ and the values are determined as a __difference to the reference state.__ \n",

    "Let's take a look at water at 0 C$^\\circ$ and 1 atm. If asked to find the __specific__ energy $U$ of this water, you might think right away that you can use $C_p\\Delta T$ but this is wrong. We cannot use this formula because we need to consider the $\\Delta T$ which refers to a change in temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we can do is use the 0 C$^\\circ$ 1 atm water as a __reference__ and compare it to changes in energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take water at 100 C$^\\circ$ 1 atm and say that __in reference to 0 C$^\\circ$ water,__ 100 C$^\\circ$ water has $420\\frac{KJ}{Kg}$ more energy than 0 C$^\\circ$ water. \n",

    "Likewise, 200 C$^\\circ$ water at 1 atm has $840\\frac{kJ}{Kg}$ more energy than water at 0 C$^\\circ$. \n",

    "By setting water at 0 C$^\\circ$. We can use the referenced values as variables known as __state variables__  also known as $\\hat{U}$ and $\\hat{H}$. \n",
