    "> As Chemical engineers, the knowledge of energy flows is integral to the industry. How will equipment affect the energy of a system? How does a reactor withstand and exothermic/endothermic reaction? Thermodynamics is the stepping stone in the study of energy flows. This notebook will give you an overview of the first law of thermodynamics."
