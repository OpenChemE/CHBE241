    "Specific heat capacity at constant volume and pressure are regarded as $C_v$ and $C_p$ respectively. In reality these values are functions of temperature. This will be covered in a separate notebook. For now we will assume that they are constants.\n",

    "If working with an monotomic species such as Helium, The value of $C_v$ is $\\frac{3}{2}R$ and the value of $C_p$ is $\\frac{5}{2}R$. Otherwise, these values will be given to you. From the monatomic relationship, it is observed that the general rule is that $C_p = C_v + R$.\n",
