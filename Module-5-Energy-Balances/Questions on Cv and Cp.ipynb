    "\n",
    "Argon in a closed system at P = 100 atm , volume of 300L and 600K is brought to a state at P = P = 200 atm, volume at 300L and 900K. What is the change of internal energy in the system? \n",

    "1. Draw a diagram of the process taking place and write the relevant equation:\n",

    "![](../figures/Module-5/cvcpq1.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta U = Q - W $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add simplifications and assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    " - We assume the only work done is via $p\\Delta V$ but since there is no change in volume $p\\Delta V = 0,\\space  \\therefore \\space W =  0$  and the equation is reduced to $\\Delta U = Q $ \n",
    "\n",
    " - Since we are working with a closed system, internal energy can be substituted as $nC_v\\Delta T$\n",
    "\n",
    " - Since we are working with argon which is an ideal monatmoic gas, we can used the ideal gas law to determine the number of mols and use $C_v$ as $R$ where $R$ is $0.08206 \\frac{L*atm}{mol*K}$\n",
    "\n",
    "   __note:__ watch out for units sometimes you will get $m^3$ and Pa!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Solve equations\n",
    "\n",
    "- since we are given a direct relationship between $U$ and $T$ we do not need to know any formulas for the heat.   \n",

    "$$ n = \\frac{P_1V_1}{R*T}  =  \\frac{300 *100 }{0.08206}) *600  = 609.3 mols$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta U = 609.3 * \\frac {3}{2} * 900 - 600 = 22,500 L*atm $$\n",
