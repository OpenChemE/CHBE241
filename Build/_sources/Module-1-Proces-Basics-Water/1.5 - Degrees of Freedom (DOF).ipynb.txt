    "To perform a DOF analysis, we need to first draw and completely label a block flow diagram (BFD). Next, we need to count the unknown variables on the BFD. After this, we need to count the independent equations relating them. Finally, we subtract the number of equations from the number of unknown variables. The result is the DOF of the process, $n_{df}$. From this calculation, there are three possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If $n_{df} = 0$ then there is the same number of unknown variables and equating equations and the problem can be solved.\n",
    "2. If $n_{df} > 0$ then there are more unknown variables than equating equations and the system cannot be solved yet. When this inequality happens, we say the question is underspecified and has infinitely many solutions.\n",
    "3. If $n_{df} < 0$ then there are less unknown variables than equating equations. This inequality means that either the BFD was incorrectly labeled or the problem was over specified with useless information. Still, the problem can be solved.\n",

The dry air contains 21 mol % oxygen, with the remaining air composed of nitrogen (79 mole %). The entering air contains 8 mol % water. Calculate the degrees of freedom.\n",
