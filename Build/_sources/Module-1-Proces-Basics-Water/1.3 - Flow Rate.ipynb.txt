    "**Mass flow rate** is the measurement of mass per unit time (mass/time). This flowrate is usually denoted by the character $\\dot{m}$, where $\\dot{m} = \\frac{ kg }{s}$. Since mass must be conserved, the input masses of a process must equal the output masses, unless there is accumulation (See [section 1.8.2](1.8 - Materials Balances.ipynb) for further reference). Therefore, mass flowrate is a very useful tool in solving material balances.\n",
