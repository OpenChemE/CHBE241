    "\n",
    "An evaporation process is often employed to obtain dry salts in a mixture. The equipment to dry the salt is the evaporator and a crystallizer. The crystallizer filters out the solid and leaves behind liquid which is often recycled to maximize yield. A diagram of this process is modeled exactly in example 4.5-2.  For us, we are looking to separate NaCo3 from water. the Feed is a 19.6 wt% of NaCO3, the crystallizer filters out solid NaCO3 and a bit of the NaCO3 solution at 40 wt% NaCO3. The solid to solution ratio is 10kg:1kg. The filtrate is also a 40 wt% solution and is recycled back to the evaporator. 45% of the water is evaporated by the evaporator. The evaporator has a maximum capacity of 175 kg/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the process is operating at maximum capacity. Draw and label a flowchart and do the degree-of-freedom analysis for the overall system, the recycle–fresh feed mixing point, the evaporator, and the crystallizer. Then write in an efficient order (minimizing simultaneous equations) the equations you would solve to determine all unknown stream variables. In each equation, circle\n",
