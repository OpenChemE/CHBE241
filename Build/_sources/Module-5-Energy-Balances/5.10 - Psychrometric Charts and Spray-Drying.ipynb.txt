    "**Relative Humidity**: Lines curving upwards describe the relative humidity $h_r  = 100 \\cdot \\frac{\\rho H_2O}{\\dot{\\rho}H_2O(T)}$. The topmost curve, or the upper boundary of the graph shows relative humidity at 100% otherwise known as the saturation curve.\n",

    "**Specific enthalpy of saturated air**: The horizontal lines show the enthalpy of saturated air. To determine the specific enthalpy of air at a certain temperature, follow the wet-bulb temperature out to the specific enthalpy curve."
