    "You are a chemical engineer at the Burnaby oil refinery. Your colleague has asked you to inform him on how much gasoline is flowing through a pipe in **SCFH**. You measure the flow rate and find that gasoline is flowing at $1.2 \\space m^3/s$ at $30 ^{\\circ} C$ The reference point for the density of gasoline is $\\rho = 730 \\space kg/m^3$ at $15 ^{\\circ} C$. The correction factor for the gasoline at $30 ^{\\circ} C$ is $\\alpha_{\\space 30 ^{\\circ} C} = 0.9811$. The correction factor for the gasoline at $0 ^{\\circ} C$ is $\\alpha_{\\space 0 ^{\\circ} C} = 1.0187$. What is the flow volumetric SCFH flow rate?\n",
