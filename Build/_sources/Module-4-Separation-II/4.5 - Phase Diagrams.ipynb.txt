    "The **red line** represents the boundary between a solid and a vapour. In this area, solid will directly turn to a vapour or a vapour will directly turn into a solid such as dry ice and $CO_2$. The **dotted green line** represents the boundary between a liquid and a solid for polar fluids such as water. Since ice is less dense than liquid water, it causes the dotted line to skew to the left. The **solid green line** represents the same thing as the **dotted green line** except for non-polar fluids. Finally, the **blue line** represents the boundary between a liquid and a vapour.\n",

    "Two main points of interest are the **triple point** and the **critical point**. The triple point is the point at which all three phases coexist at a certain pressure and temperature. The critical point is the point at which if you increase the pressure or temperature, a gas becomes indistinguishable from the liquid. The phase in this region is called a **supercritical fluid**.\n",
