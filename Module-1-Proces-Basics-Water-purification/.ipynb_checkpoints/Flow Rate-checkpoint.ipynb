    "### Mass Flow Rate\n",
    "Mass flow rate is the measurement of mass per unit time (mass/time). This flowrate is usually denoted by this character $ \\dot{m} $ where $ \\dot{m} = \\frac{ kg }{s} $. Since mass must be conserved, the input masses of a process must equal the output masses, unless there is accumulation. Therefore, mass flowrate is a very useful tool in solving material balances."

Since the total number of moles of each element must be conserved, it is useful in solving both reactive and non reactive problems."

    "Volumetric flow rate is the measurement of volume per unit time (volume/time) This flow rate is usually denoted by this character $ \\dot{V} $, where $ \\dot{V} = \\frac{ m^3 }{s} $. Although volume is nearly conserved for solids and liquids, it is not for gases. For example if a gas is flowing through a nozzle, the mass flow rate will not change but the gas will compress or expand. \n",
