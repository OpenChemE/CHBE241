    "**Vapour-Liquid Equilibrium** (VLE) occurs under certain circumstances where both a liquid and a vapour of one or more substances coexist. An example of this is half full jerrycan with gasoline. Gasoline is comprised of multiple types of hydrocarbons. At the bottom half of the can, there is only liquid gasoline. At the top half, there is gasoline vapour. The vapour and liquid are at equilibrium, meaning that there is as much vapour becoming liquid as liquid becoming vapour."

    "The **bubble-point temperature** is the temperature at which the first vapour bubbles form when a liquid is heated slowly at given pressure. On the other hand **dew-point temperature** is the temperature at which the first liquid droplets form when a vapour is cooled slowly at given pressure. Calculating the bubble-point and dew-point temperatures can be difficult but if the liquid and gas behave ideally, then the calculations are relatively straightforward.\n",
