    "By the end of this section you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the concept of vapour pressure.\n",
    "2. Use the Antoine equation.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",

    "**Vapour pressure** is the pressure a vapour exerts with its solid or liquid at a given temperature at equilibrium. This means that vapour pressure is a good indication of a liquid's evaporation rate or a solid's sublimation rate.\n"

    "## Vapour Pressure\n",

    "As you can see in the figure bellow, vapour pressure is at equilibrium. This means that there is as much vapour being produced from evaporation as vapour being consumed due to condensation. The magnitude of the vapour pressure tells you how volatile the liquid is. The higher the vapour pressure, the higher the volatility.\n",

Raoult's law is generally valid when $x_A$ is close to 1, which means the liquid is almost pure A. Henry's law is generally valid when solutions of $x_A$ are close to 0.\n",
