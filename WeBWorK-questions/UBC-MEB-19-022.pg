Process Classification:
$BR
A pharmaceutical company uses bacteria to produce a drug for cancer patients. The process for production of the drug is to add bacteria and nutrients into a reactor and seal it. At some point in time later, another amount of nutrients are added to the reactor, with nothing removed, so the bacteria continue producing the drug. Following nutrient addition the reactor is again sealed until it is eventually opened to recover the final product.
$BR 
$BR 
a) What process classification best describes this process?
$BR 
\{ $mcq1->buttons()\}

$BR 
$BR 
b) Considering the point in time where the additional nutrients are added to the reactor, what would be the general balance equation that would have the terms that best apply to account for the mass in the reactor vessel at that point in time? All of the terms in the equation should be non-zero.
$BR
