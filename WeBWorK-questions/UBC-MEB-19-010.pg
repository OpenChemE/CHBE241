Process Classification:
$BR
Consider this system: As part of the maple syrup production process. A dilute maple sugar solution is heated in an open tank, part of the water evaporates and leaves the system. This then creates a concentrated maple sugar solution (maple syrup) which is removed and the process can then be repeated.
