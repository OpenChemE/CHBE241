BEGIN_PGML
Butane is burned with air in a furnace to provide heat for a facility. 10.0 [`m^3/hr`] of butane is fed with [$A].0 [`m^3/hr`] of air (79% Nitrogen and 21% oxygen by moles with an average molecular weight (MW) of 29 g/mol, these are common assumptions for air used in this class). The butane has a
density of 2.48 [`kg/m^3`] and the air has a density of 1.23 [`kg/m^3`]. One reactant (butane or oxygen) is provided in excess. By how many moles in excess is this reactant provided and what is the percentage excess (note that this percentage may be more than 100%)?

moles of excess reactant...... :* [________] [``gmol/hr``]

percentage excess of excess reactant...... :* [________] [``%``] Entered out of 100, eg. for "20.5%" enter "20.5".
