BEGIN_PGML
The Leblanc process was patented in 1791 and is used to produce sodium
carbonate ([`Na_2CO_3`]). Sodium carbonate is a common commodity chemical used in the manufacture of many products such as glass and paper. Sodium carbonate is produced in the Leblanc process through the following balanced reaction:

[`Na_2SO_4 (s) + CaCO_3 (s)+ 2C (s) \rightarrow Na_2CO_3 (s)+ 2CO_2 (g)+ CaS (s)`]

If this process is fed with [$n_Na2SO4] mol [`Na_2SO_4`], [$n_CaCO3] mol
[`CaCO_3`] and [$n_C] mol
[`C`] (carbon) and has a conversion of [$conv]% of [`CaCO_3`]. 

a) What is the percent excess of carbon?  
percent excess carbon...... :* [________] %

b) How many moles of [`CO_2`] are produced?  
moles of [`CO_2`] produced...... :* [________] mol
