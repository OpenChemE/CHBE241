BEGIN_PGML
In a petrochemical plant, [$S_A_ini]% relative saturation of toluene is detected in a flue (waste) gas stream. To satisfy the regulatory limit of 10 ppmv (vol./vol.) toluene in the flue gas, activated carbon monolith is installed in a waste gas holding tank downstream to remove the toluene from the waste gas. This is done in batches in a tank that has a volume of [$V]-litre and contains an air-toluene mixture. Pressure and temperature are maintained at 1 atm and 60 deg C during this adsorption. 

For adsorption of toluene onto activated carbon, the number of moles of toluene adsorbed per kg of activated carbon [`X_i*`] is given by Langmuir-Freundlich Equation below, which is a modification of Langmuir Isotherm equation.

[`` X_i* = (a (K_Lp_i)^n)/(1+ (K_Lp_i)^n) ``]

where 
[`X_i*`] is the mole of toluene adsorbed per mass of activated carbon, mol/kg  
[`p_i`] is the partial pressure of toluene, Pa  
[`a`] = 3.3 mol/kg; [`K_L`] = 6.9E-11 [`Pa^{-1}`], [`n`] = 0.39

Calculate the number of moles of toluene removed by the activated carbon to exactly satisfy the regulatory limit in each batch and the minimum required amount of activated carbon to remove the toluene to exactly satisfy the regulatory limit.



Number of moles of toluene removed by the activated carbon ...... :* [________] [``mol``]  
Minimum required amount of activated carbon...... :* [________]  [``kg``]
