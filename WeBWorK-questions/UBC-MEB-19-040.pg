### Problem Statement

In an experiment, you are required to dilute [$n_S] moles of pure sulfuric acid (100% [`H_2SO_4`]) in a flask with enough pure water to produce a 35 mole% aqueous solution of the acid. Dilution of pure sulfuric acid with water is known to be highly exothermic. The excessive energy released from dilution of sulfuric acid can be dangerous to an experimenter. 

### Part A

As a cautious and meticulous experimenter, you decided to calculate the energy released from this dilution process to determine the amount of energy that needs to be removed to keep the final solution at the initial temperature. Using the data from the table below, calculate this energy in kJ. Note the reference for the table is that [`\Delta \hat{H}_m`] is zero for pure sulfuric acid and pure water.

Energy released or taken in from dilution of sulfuric acid (negative if exothermic) ...... :* [________] kJ  


### Part B

The empty flask has a mass of [$m_flask] g, while the heat capacity of the flask
and its contents as a whole is 5.4 J/g-K (this includes the liquids inside). The flask and its content are initially at 25 deg C. What will be the final temperature of the flask and its contents if the system is assumed to be adiabatic?

Final temperature of the flask and its contents  ...... :* [________] deg C
