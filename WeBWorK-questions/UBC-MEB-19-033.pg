BEGIN_PGML
Oil from various plants can be extracted using solvent such as n-hexane. In such a process, sesame seeds, containing [$w_O] wt% oil and [$w_S] wt% solid are ground and fed into a stirred tank along with n-hexane. We will call this stirred tank an extractor. The feed ratio is [$r_F] kg of n-hexane into the extractor per kg of sesame seeds. Following extraction, the stream of n-hexane, oil and solids are sent to a filter to extract all solids. The filter cake, that comes from the filter, has [$w_FC] wt% solids and the remainder as oil and n-hexane that are still attached to the solids. The oil and hexane in the filter cake have the same ratio as when they emerged from the extractor. The oil and hexane that is not trapped in the filter cake is sent to an evaporator, where the hexane is evaporated, and oil leaves as a liquid. We will assume this is a perfect separation for simplicity. The hexane is sent to a condenser which cools it to a liquid and is then fed back to the start of the process. The final product of sesame oil is stored in drums and shipped.

Calculate the yield of sesame oil to product (kg oil to kg sesame seeds fed), the required feed ratio of fresh feed of hexane (kg fresh hexane to kg sesame seeds fed) and the recycle to fresh feed ratio for hexane (kg hexane recycled/kg fresh hexane feed).


Calculate:  
Yield of sesame oil to sesame seed feed............. :* [________]  kg oil to kg sesame seeds fed  
Required fresh feed of hexane ............. :* [________]  kg hexane to kg sesame seeds fed  
The recycle to fresh feed ratio for hexane ....... :* [________]  kg hexane recycled/kg fresh hexane feed
