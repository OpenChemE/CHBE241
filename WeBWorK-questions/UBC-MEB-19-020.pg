BEGIN_PGML
Parrafin wax is a mixture of long chain hydrocarbons used in a variety of applications such as candle making or electrical insulation. Most paraffin is derived from petroleum refining. Paraffin is produced in Canada at an average rate of 1500 barrels per day according to the American Fuel and Petroleum Manufacturers. This measure refers to an oil barrel, which is roughly 159 litres. If The average density of paraffin is [$D] [``kg/m^3``] and the average molecular weight is [$W] g/mol, what is the flow of paraffin from the plant in kg and moles per day?



* Flow in kg/day...... :* [______] [``kg/day``]
* Flow in moles/day...... :* [______] [``mol/day``]

Make sure to use the capital "E" for scientific notation.
