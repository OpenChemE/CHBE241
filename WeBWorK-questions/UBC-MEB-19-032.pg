BEGIN_PGML

During World War II, there was a large demand for the production of toluene for use in explosives. Following the war, there was much lower demand for explosives, and thus another use for toluene had to be found. Production of synthetic polymers, such as nylon, was a promising industry. Toluene could be dealkylated by reacting it with hydrogen in order to produce benzene. Benzene could then be used as a precursor to a variety of chemical products such as nylon. The main reaction for this process is as follows:

[`C_6H_5CH_3 + H_2 \rightleftharpoons C_6H_6 + CH_4`]  

However, a reversible side reaction also occurs to produce an undesired product known as biphenyl:

[`2 C_6H_6 \rightleftharpoons C_6H_5C_6H_5 + H_2`]  

The reactor is fed with [$n_T] kmol/hr of toluene and [$excess_H]% excess of hydrogen. The reaction has a toluene conversion of [$conv]% and a selectivity of [$select]:1 of benzene to diphenyl. What will be the exiting flows of the following species? 

Mole flows of:  
[`C_6H_5CH_3`]............. :* [________]  kmol/hr  
[`C_6H_6`] ............. :* [________]  kmol/hr  
[`C_6H_5C_6H_5`] ....... :* [________]  kmol/hr
