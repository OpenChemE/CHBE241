BEGIN_PGML
A wastewater treatment plant has a maximum capacity of half a million litres per day. A influent stream of wastewater with [$x_s_in] [`mg/L`] suspended solids goes into the plant. In the plant, 5/6 of the suspended solids is removed. Assume the flow of this removed solids stream is negligible and does not affect the flow rate of the discharge stream. The treated water is discharged in an effluent stream. During heavy rain events, the influent flow rate can be more than the capacity of the treatment plant. To avoid damaging the plant, any excess bypasses the plant to the effluent stream and mixes with the treated water. On a stormy day, the plant receives [$m_in] [`litres`] of influent.  What is the level of suspended solids in the discharged effluent? 

Level of suspended solids...... :* [______] [`mg/L`]
