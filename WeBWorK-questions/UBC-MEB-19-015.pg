BEGIN_PGML
A mixture of butane and propane is used as fuel for cooking on a shipping vessel and contains [$B][`%`] butane and the remainder is propane. The mixture is pressurized in a [$V] [`m^3`] tank onboard the ship. The pressure inside the tank can be read with a gauge and shows that it is pressurised to [$P] [`bar`]. When the tank is empty or "open to atmosphere", the gauge reads 0. The ambient temperature is [$T$] [`deg C`]. 

a. What is the absolute partial pressure of butane in [`kPa`]? What is the partial gas volume of propane in [`litres`]?

absolute partial pressure of butane...... :* [________] [``kPa``]

partial gas volume of propane...... :* [________] [``litres``]
