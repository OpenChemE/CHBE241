    "In this section, we will be exploring phase equilibriums and the temperatures and pressures that allow the equilibrium to exist in chemical processes (e.g. boiling points, sublimation points). We will also be factoring in the phase equilibriums in our mass and energy balances for separation cases, such as in a distillation column."

    "Solid-Liquid Equilibrium is the point where the temperature and pressure point where a solid and a liquid can co-exist. This is usually the **melting or freezing points** of a substance. Since a solid is very hard to transport over a process, we usually melt it into liquid form and collect it as a precipitant at the end of the process.\n",

    "**Miscible** liquids are liquids that can mix together to form a single phase. If water and methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) are mixed at 25C, a single phase results; otherwise, the mixture separates into two liquid phases, one of which contains 98% H2O and 2% MIBK and the other 97.7% MIBK and 2.3% H2O. Water and MIBK are examples of **partially miscible** liquids; they would be termed **immiscible** if one phase contained a negligible amount of water and the other a negligible amount of MIBK."
