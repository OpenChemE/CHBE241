    "Figure 1. is the block flow diagram for a separator ($T$ = Toluene and $B$ = Benzene). A separator is characterized with a single input, followed by 2 or more product streams **with different molar or mass composition than the feed stream.** These streams usually also have different states compared to the feed stream, for instance the overhead stream could be composed of gaseous feed versus the bottom product where the feed is still liquid. VLE calculations need to be taken into account in terms of the energy and masses conserved. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. If the input stream does not have a flow rate listed in the question or the diagram, assume a mass or volumteric flow rate of a random number, preferrably a mass flow rate with a nice round number like 100 $kg/h$. \n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "2. Draw and label the flow chart based on the question.\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "3. Write expressions for the quantities requested in the problem statement. (e.g. $m_3$ = $m_{B3}$ + $m_{T3}$, $x_B$ = $m_{B3}/m_3$). The expressions should be written to help in solving for the missing parameters of the process.\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "4. Convert all mixed units to one uniform units. In most cases, it would be converting all the units to masses. A few methods to remember to use are \n",
    "    1. Molecular weights\n",
    "    2. Molecular fractions.\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "5. Perform a degree-of-freedom analysis on the process to determine if it is solvable. \n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "6. **Do the algebra.** "
