    "## What is dimensional homogeneity?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's define what is a dimension and what is a unit. Dimensions are a measurable extent of some kind, such as length($L$), time ($T$), mass ($M$) etc. Units are labels for different dimensions and combination of dimensions, such as kilograms ($kg$), Newtons ($N$) etc. \n",

    "Dimensional homogeneity is the concept where the dimensions of variables on both sides of an equation are the same. If the units are the same, it follows that the dimensions of each term must be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every valid equation must be dimensionally homogeneous: that is, all additive terms on both sides of the equation must have the same dimensions.\n",

    "### Can an equation be dimensionally homogenous but inconsistent in units?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Take the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u(m/s) = u_0(m/s) + g(m/{s^2})\\cdot t(s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is dimensionally homogenous and consistent in units.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ MT^{-1} = MT^{-1} + MT^{-2} \\cdot T $$\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if we neglect to put the $t$ variable to convert the gravitational constant to velocty, the equation become **dimensionally inhomogenous and inconsistent in units**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u(m/s) = u_0(m/s) + g(m/{s^2})$$\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "$$ MT^{-1} = MT^{-1} + MT^{-2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An exmaple of an equation being **dimensionally homogenous but inconsistent in units** is if the units on one side of the equation are different than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u(m/min) = u_0(m/min) + g(m/{min^2})\\cdot t(s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, usually the fix is to take the variable with the wrong units and use the appropriate conversion to assign the proper units to it (In this case, it's dividing $t$ by 60 to change it into minutes)."
