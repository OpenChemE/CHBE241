    "Acetone ($C_3H_6O_{(L)}$) is fed at a rate of 400 L/min into a heated chamber, where it evaporates into a nitrogen stream. The gas leaving the heater is diluted by another nitrogen stream flowing at a measured rate of 419 $m^3$ (STP)/min. The combined gases are then compressed to a total pressure $P$ = 6.3 atm gauge at a temperature of 325 &deg;C. The partial pressure of acetone in this stream is $P_a$ = 501 mm Hg. Atmospheric pressure is 763 mm Hg\n",
