    "\n",
    "According to our comparison, we should first deduce what the states of the reactants and the products, and thier respective stoichiometric values, can tell us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The total enthalpy of the reactants in the second reaction is lower than the first reaction by the amount of the heat of vaporization of butane.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The total enthalpy of the products in the second reaction is higher than the first reaction by 5 times the amount of the heat of vaporization of water. \n",
    "\n",
