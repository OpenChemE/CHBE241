    "1. Know the four basic unit operations covered in this course.\n",
    "2. Understand how each of the unit operations work.\n",
    "3. Understand the purpose of each unit operation.\n",

    "## 1.2.1 &ndash; Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In chemical engineering, a unit operation is a step in a process. Each of these steps gets the raw feedstock closer to the final products. Different unit operations have different functionalities and purposes. We will cover **mixers**, **reactors**, **separators**, and **splitters** in this course."

    "## 1.2.2 &ndash; Mixer\n",
    "\n",
    "In a process, a **mixer** is a unit operation that attempts to make a **heterogeneous** system into a **homogenous** system. Examples include scrambling eggs, mixing sugar and cream into coffee, and a Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor used in water treatment. A mixer allows heat and/or mass transfer to occur between one or more streams. \n",

    "## 1.2.3 &ndash; Reactor\n",
    "\n",
    "In a process, a **reactor** is a unit operation that is designed to contain a chemical reaction. These reactions can include anything from burning natural gas to chlorination of water for purification purposes.\n",

    "## 1.2.4 &ndash; Separator \n",
    "\n",
    "In a process, a **separator** is a unit operation that converts a mixture of chemical species to two or more distinct products. Think of separators as opposite of mixers. An example of a separator is in distillation, where you are trying to separate the impurities from the alcohol. \n",

    "\n",
    "In a process, a **splitter** is a unit operation that splits a line into two or more directions. This is similar to a separator except the product lines have the same chemical makings.\n",
