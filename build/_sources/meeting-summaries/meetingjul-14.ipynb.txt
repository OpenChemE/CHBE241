    "### Changes Week 1\n",
    "1. Completed the first draft of module one, half of the introduction notebook, and MATH 152.\n",
    "2. Got rid of conservation of mass as its own section and included it onto material balances\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions/Comments\n",
    "1. Continous, batch, and semi-batch should be moved to module one.\n",
    "2. I dont think we should have a section about excel since we will be using python instead.\n",
    "3. Could we get the slides from last year? Would be nice to have something to refer too in terms of how indepth we should go into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "1. Found it hard to come up with examples, I used a mixture of my own, textbook, and online examples. Not sure if we should only make our own.\n",
    "2. Should each notebook be content heavy?"

    "### Suggestions/Comments\n",
    "- Have been trying to look for examples that are not fromthe textbook to give stuents more variety\n",
    " - not been too sucessful\n",
    "- Agree with Said: Material balance belongs with processes.\n",
    "- Some notebooks are content heavy. Some are very short\n",
    "- I think that  reactive balances are a separate section that should come after separation. \n",
    " - if the general balance is $ A = I - O + G -C  $  then i think the flow should be on  the __input__  and __output__ $\\rightarrow$  then on the __consumption__ and __generation__\n",
