    "In this section, we will be exploring **phase equilibriums**, **chemical and physical properties** and **temperatures and pressures** that allow the equilibrium to exist in chemical processes (e.g. boiling points, sublimation points). We will also be learning about chemical properties of  We will also be factoring in the phase equilibriums in our mass and energy balances for separation cases, such as in a distillation column."

    "## Solid-Liquid Equilibrium &ndash; melting and freezing\n",
    "\n",
    "Solid-Liquid Equilibrium, as a **physical** property of a substance, is the point where the temperature and pressure point where a solid and a liquid can co-exist. This is usually the **melting or freezing points** of a substance. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage even when the heating is continued, the temperature does not change until the whole of solid is converted into liquid. The state when solid and liquid phases of a substance coexist is called **solid-liquid equilibrium**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since a solid is very hard to transport over a process, we usually melt it into liquid form and collect it as a precipitant at the end of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solid-Liquid Equilibrium &ndash; solubility\n",
    "\n",
    "Solid-Liquid Equilibrium, as a **chemical** property of a solid substance, is the **solubility** of the solid substance. Solubility refers to the ability of a given solute to dissolve in a solvent.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is measured in terms of the maximum amount of solute dissolved in a solvent at equilibrium. The resulting solution is called a **saturated solution**. Under various conditions, the equilibrium solubility can be exceeded to give a so-called **supersaturated solution**.\n",

    "Solid-Vapour Equilibrium is the temperature and presure point where a solid and a vapour can co-exist. The temperature and pressure point is called the **sublimation** point. A prime example of this equilibrium is dry ice, which is frozen carbon dioxide. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Miscible** liquids are liquids that can mix together to form a single phase. If water and methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) are mixed at 25C, a single phase results; otherwise, the mixture separates into two liquid phases, one of which contains 98% H2O and 2% MIBK and the other 97.7% MIBK and 2.3% H2O. Water and MIBK are examples of **partially miscible** liquids; they would be termed **immiscible** if one phase contained a negligible amount of water and the other a negligible amount of MIBK.\n",
