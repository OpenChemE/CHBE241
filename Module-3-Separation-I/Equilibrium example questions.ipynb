    "One hundred kilograms of a saturated aqueous solution of $AgNO_3$ at 100 &deg;C is cooled to 20 &deg;C, thereby forming $AgNO_3$ crystals, which are filtered from the remaining solution. The wet filter cake, which contains 80% solid crystals and 20% saturated solution by mass, passes to a dryer in which the remaining water is vaporized. Calculate the fraction of the $AgNO_3$ in the feed stream eventually recovered as dry crystals and the amount of water that must be removed in the drying stage."
