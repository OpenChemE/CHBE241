A separator is characterized with a single input, followed by 2 or more product streams **with different molar/mass compositions, sometimes even states of matter, than the feed stream.** \n",

The mass flow rate of the stream should therefore be considered an unknown process variable and labeled as such on the chart. Its value will be determined from the known volumetric flow rate and density of the feed stream.\n",

    "1. List all assumptions and relationshps. If the input stream does not have a flow rate listed in the question or the diagram, assume a mass or volumteric flow rate of a random number, preferrably a mass flow rate with a nice round number like 100 $kg/h$. \n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "2. Draw and label the flow chart based on the question. We will not be considering chemical reactions between constituents of the fresh feed and reactor feed in the feed streams, only when they're in the separator.\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "3. Write expressions for the quantities requested in the problem statement. (e.g. $m_3$ = $m_{B3}$ + $m_{T3}$, $x_B$ = $ \\frac{m_{B3}}{m_3}$). The expressions should be written to help in solving for the missing parameters of the process.\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "4. Perform a degree-of-freedom analysis on the process to determine if it is solvable. \n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "5. Convert all mixed units to one uniform units. In most cases, it would be converting all the units to masses, but in the case of reactive systems, you'd want to convert them to moles per unit time.\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "6. **Do the algebra.** \n",
