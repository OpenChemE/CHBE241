    "A waste stream containing 5.15 wt% chromium enters a waste water treatment process. The treatment unit has a maximum intake capacity of 4500 kg wastewater/h. The treatment unit extracts 95% of the chromium in the feed. The residual liquid leaving the treatment unit is sent to a waste lagoon. If there is an excess of waste water (greater than the 4500 kg/h capacity), the excess waste water bypasses the treatment unit and combines with the residual liquid stream that goes to the waste lagoon. Supose 6000 kg wastewater/h enters the process.\n",
