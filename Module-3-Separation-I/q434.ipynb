    "> An evaporation process is often employed to obtain dry salts in  a mixture. The equipment to dry the salt is the evaporator and a crystallizer. The crystallizer filters out the solid and leaves behind liquid which is often recycled to maximize yield. A diagram of this process is modeled exactly in eample 4.5-2.  For us, we are looking to separate NaCo3 from water. the Feed is a 19.6 wt% of NaCO3, The crystallizer filters out solid NaCO3 and a bit of the NaCO3 solution at 40 wt% NaCO3. The solid to solution ratio is 10kg:1kg. The filtrate is also a 40 wt% solution and is recycled back to the evaporator. 45% of the water is evaporated by the evaporator. The evaporator has a maximum capacity of 175 kg/s.\n",
